        Hello! My name is Kaity Goodwin and I want to be your 2021-2022 Campus
        Activities Board President!

      <h2>My CAB History</h2>
      <p>
        I have been involved with CAB since I was a freshman. I attended almost
        all the Welcome Week activities, and some of you may even recognize me
        from my infamous Bingo wni (winning a TV and Delta Vouchers in the same
        game. After my high school event planning experience and my passion for
        the CAB events I had attended thus far, I knew I wanted to be a part of
        CAB and so I applied for the events committee. Through my experience on
        the events committee, I learned the ins and outs of large scale events
        at Babson. I got a hand in planning the Winter Welcome Week events, got
        to design several t shirts and giveaways, and even created all of the
        Offset Spring Concert marketing materials!
        <br />
        Sophomore year, I applied for and was elected as co VP of Events. Here,
        I planned over 60 events for the Babson community including several
        homegrown events such as the welcome back photo scavenger hunt, music
        bingo, and Cash CAB. I approached every event with passion, creativity,
        and dedication. I also loved ordering all the prizes and giveaways for
        fan favorite events such as trivia and Bingo.
        <br />
        When it came to the school shutting down in March, I played an integral
        part in helping our team pivot to online events and working closely with
        my Co-VP of Events in turning the rest of our semester into virtual
        events for everyone. We created an efficient online Bingo system, ran
        fun and new photo scavenger hunts and challenges, and I was charged with
        the difficult task of distributing and managing prizes for all of our
        off campus winners.
        <br />
        Junior year, I pivoted from events and assumed the position of co-VP of
        Marketing. Here, I streamlined and created an efficient and effective
        CAB brand for all of our instagram and social media marketing. I knew I
        wanted CAB to have a cohesive brand so that everything was quickly and
        well recognizable. We also focused heavily on digital marketing in our
        new virtual world, as well as thinking of new in-person marketing
        strategies such as our pop up booths and the upcoming events board in
        Reynolds behind the info desk. I loved ordering all the CAB Giveaways
        for the pop up booths and bringing fun and useful items to the Babson
        community!

      <h2>My Goals as CAB President</h2>
      <p>
        In this time, we never know what to expect even the next day. Things are
        constantly changing and the state of our country and of our community is
        also ever changing. So far this year, I have loved supporting in-person
        events and bringing students that joy of CAB events that we are so
        familiar with. As president, I would strive to ensure that we are able
        to still have in-person events and do my best to create a safe
        environment for these things to happen. Given my creative nature and
        background and strong event planning history, I am confident that I will
        be able to continue to think outside the box and provide everyone with
        more engaging and in-person activities.
