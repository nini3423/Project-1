              Hello! My name is Kaity and I'm running for CAB President. I have
              been involved in the Campus Activities Board since I arrived on
              campus freshman year. My CAB involvement started when I won both a
              TV and a $400 Delta Airline voucher at welcome week bingo. I
              became involved in the committees shortly thereafter and thus
              began my CAB career. Learn more about my journey and about what I
              have accomplished in one of the largest organizations on campus
              and about why I want to be president and how I can give back to
              this campus!
